# 📧 Email Spam Detection System

A Machine Learning-based Email Spam Detection web application built using **Python**, **Flask**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The application classifies email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** through a simple and interactive web interface.

---

## 📖 Overview

Email spam is one of the most common problems in digital communication. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to automatically detect whether an email is spam or legitimate. It leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction, and a trained classification model to provide accurate predictions in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect spam emails automatically.
- Improve email security by filtering unwanted messages.
- Demonstrate the use of Machine Learning for text classification.
- Provide a user-friendly web interface for spam prediction.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📩 Predicts whether an email is Spam or Not Spam.
- ⚡ Real-time prediction using a trained Machine Learning model.
- 🌐 Interactive web interface built with Flask.
- 📝 Text preprocessing using NLP techniques.
- 💾 Uses pre-trained model and vectorizer for faster predictions.
- 🚀 Lightweight and easy to deploy.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters an email message.
2. The text is preprocessed and transformed into numerical features using the saved vectorizer.
3. The trained Machine Learning model predicts whether the email is Spam or Not Spam.
4. The result is displayed instantly on the web page.
